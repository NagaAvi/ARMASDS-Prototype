# AR Mobility Assistant for Safe Driving System (ARMASDS) - Prototype

## Project Overview

ARMASDS (Augmented Reality Mobility Assistant for Safe Driving System) is a cutting-edge AR-based system designed to assist drivers in navigating hazardous conditions. This prototype leverages augmented reality to project real-time hazard warnings, navigation instructions, and other critical information directly onto the windshield, helping drivers avoid potential risks and improve situational awareness.

This Unity-based game prototype simulates a driving environment that includes navigation, hazard detection, weather conditions, and speed sign recognition. The system's goal is to enhance road safety by providing immediate feedback and proactive route adjustments for drivers.

## Key Features

- **Customizable AR HUD**: Augmented alerts projected directly onto the windshield for immediate driver action.
- **Smart City Integration**: Connects with infrastructure to receive live updates on road conditions, traffic, and hazards.
- **Dynamic Route Adjustments**: Provides alternate, safer routes based on real-time hazard detection.
- **Real-Time AR Hazard Detection**: Detects potholes, debris, and weather impacts using LiDAR, sensors, and cameras.

## Requirements

- **Unity** (for development and simulation)
- **Windows PC** (for running the executable)
- **AR-enabled hardware** (optional, if implementing on physical devices)

## How to Play

1. Download the **ARMASDS** file from this repository.
2. Open the **.exe** file to run the game.
3. Use the arrow keys (or WASD) to control the vehicle and navigate the environment.
4. The game will provide AR-based alerts for hazards like speed signs, potholes, and weather-related obstacles.

## Future Work

- Implement full AR hazard detection using real sensors.
- Add vehicle detection and dynamic route changes.
- Expand the game with more levels and features related to real-world driving scenarios.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of the game (ARMASDS.exe).
2. Run the executable on a Windows machine.
